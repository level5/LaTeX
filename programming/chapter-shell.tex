\paragraph{Builtin}
A builtin is a command contained within the Bash tool set, literally built in. This is either for performance reason -{}- builtins execute faster than external commands, which usually require forking off a sparate process -{}- or because a particular builtin needs direct access to the shell internals.

A builtin may be a synonym to a system command of the same name, but Bash reimplements it internally. For example, the Bash echo command is not the same as  /bin/echo, although their behavior is almost identical.

\paragraph{Keyword}
A keyword is a reserved word, token or operator. Keywords has a special meaning to the shell, and indeed are the building blocks of the shell's syntax. As examples, for, while, do, and ! are keywords. Similar to a builtin, a keyword is hard-coded into Bash, but unlike a builtin, a keyword is not in itself a command, but a subunit of a command construct.
